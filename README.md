no changes added to commit

## Purpose of the following Commands:
- `mkdir`: [This is used to make a brand new directory]
- `cd`: [To change between directories in your computer/laptop]

- `ls`: [To list down all the files in the current directory]
- `git init`: [It creates a new git repository]
- `git status`: [To see the current status of the directory]
- `git add`: [To add the change in the current directory to the staging area]
- `git commit`: [It is used to save on the local repository]
- `git push`: [Used to upload a local repository to a remote repository]
- `git pull`: [Used to fetch and download the contents of the remote repository into a local repository]
- `git log`: [It displays committed snapshots]
- `git branch`: [A moveable pointer to one of the commits]
- `git merge`: [It's used to putting lines of development created by git branch and putting them into one single branch]
- `git checkout`: [It is used to tell git which branch or commit you want your changes too]

## Why Version Control is Important

With version control, it is possible to:
- Helps keep track of any modifications on code
- Shows how a project changed through the process
- Protects from human errors
- It allows more people to work on the same project at the same time

- I have been learning about bash since highschool due to my friends
